Designing a Processor using ALU unit to perform different operations by dividing it into different cycles.

Firstly the program counter(PC) supplies the address of an instruction to be executed and points to the memory location where the next instruction is stored. 

The processor fetches the instruction from memory based on the address and then stores it in a special register within the processor.

 Then the processor decodes it to determine the operation to be performed and the operands involved.
 
These operands could be stored in registers, memory locations, or immediate values within the instruction itself after reading. 

Lastly the processor executes the operation specified by the instruction.

For example, in the case of an ADD operation, the processor reads the values from the specified registers or memory locations, adds the values of the operands together and executes.
